        the International level. Regular cultural activities at Ranchi University level are an integral part of Ranchi University's academics calendar. Jharkhand being tribal-dominated State, with variegated eco-environmental conditions, the University,
        since its inception, has a majority of its students who belong to poor economic and educational background. Coming from Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Caste, OBC, and minorities inhabiting the area, these are first-generation learners. That is, their
        parents and family are illiterate, having no tradition of – and in many cases no motivation for – education. This poses a challenge before this University – a challenge this University is committed to face with the motto of enlightenment, education,
        service and discipline.
